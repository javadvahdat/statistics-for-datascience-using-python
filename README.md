Statistics course teaching files for data science in jupyter notebook( basic level )

## contents
- **01- Algorithem:** Algorithm concepts and how to deal with problems through the use of algorithms.
- **02- FlowChart:** Steps to draw a flowchart based on a programming standard and a few practical examples.
- **03- Data Gathering:** How and steps to collect data and introduce sites from which we can get data according to the subject under study.
- **04- Preprocessing data:** After the stage of collecting data from various sources, in this stage we perform the final processing before starting the analysis.
- **05- Mean-Median-Mode:** Descriptive statistics starting from the criteria of tendency to centrality.
- **06- Variance and StandardError:** Criteria of dispersion, variance and squared means standard deviation.
- **07- Percentiles and Skewness:** percentiles, squares, as well as the asymmetry of the graph using skewness.
- **08- Descriptive Statistics:** Includes all the criteria mentioned above in summary and in one command.
- **09- Frequency tables:** Frequency and relative frequency tables and cross tables.
- **10- Histogram:** Use histograms to show the frequency of continuous data.
- **11- Distributions:** Introducing different statistical distributions and how to work with their parameters.
- **12- Normal Distribution:** Demonstrate how to draw a normal diagram as well as generate random data from a normal distribution with different parameters.
- **13- Hypothesis Testing:** Introducing the test of statistical hypotheses and in particular the test of equality of the average of the two population.
- **14- P-Value:** Level of significance and how the hypothetical test can be rejected or accepted.
- **15- Bootstrap:** Repeat sampling of existing data due to lack of data or the need for more iteration to better and more accurately estimate the parameters.
- **16- Confidence Intervals:** An interval that tells you that in probability `1-\apha`, your parameter occurs in that range.
- **17- Data Manipulation:** Select a subset of data with specific conditions, Delete and add rows and columns, Delete or fill in missing data.
- **18- Dealing with missing data:** Different ways to fill in missing data.
- **19- linear model:** The most important part of the course, Learn linear model and choose the best model and its different methods, The difference between machine learning and statistical learning is well explained in this section.
